    <h3>A compiler for Latte programming language</h3>
    <p>
        This project was developed as an assignment in the 'Compiler construction' course at the University of Warsaw.
        The compiler was for code written in Latte (get its grammar from <a href="content/projects/Latte.cf.txt" target="_blank">here</a>) – a programming language which is a subset of Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        I implemented the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>primary expressions and statements (loops, assignments, functions, if-else statements, etc.);</li>
            <li>four types: int, string, boolean, void;</li>
            <li>IO operations: printInt, printString, readInt, readString;</li>
            <li>arrays;</li>
            <li>full object-oriented programming support – structures, classes (attributes, methods, inheritence, virtual methods).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The front-end (a lexical and semantics analysis) and back-end (an assembly code generation) of the compiler
        were written in <strong>Haskell</strong>. Testing scripts were written in <strong>Python</strong>.
        A parser was generated by the <strong>bnfc</strong> tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The compiler outputs assembly code that can be run on x86 architectures.
        Programs written in Latte can be very easily translated to Java programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I contributed new functionality – the reference counting garbage collection.
        The source code is published and freely available on Github.

        In a team of four students, we developed a mobile application for creating, viewing and sharing interactive 'amusements'.
        Amusements may consist of photos, sounds and simple interactions with the user.
        Gadgets are created in an intuitive graphical editor which is an Andorid app.
        Once an amusement is created, it can be stored on the server.
        The user is then able to send a link with the gadget to friends or share it on social networking services.

        This application was a part of my Bachelor’s thesis in Computer Science.
        It has been published in Google Play under “Amoose” name.
        Our work was reviewed as "very good".
        The idea for this project came from an engineer who works at Google.

    <h3>Graph drawer</h3>
    <p>
        The project is a demo that demonstrates <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>AngularJS</strong> capabilities.
        It is a SPA which entirely runs in a web browser environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        My purpose was to implement a few graph algorithms. In the current version,
        a user can enter graph directed edges as well as two distinguished nodes.
        Then, he can run one of the following algorithms that determine:
        <ul>
            <li>if a path exists from the starting point to the destination points;</li>
            <li>if the graph in an Eulerian graph;</li>
            <li>if the graph in a Hamiltonian graph.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The third algorithm can take a lot of time, so the algorithm computations are delegated to a web worker –
        a HTML5 feature that simulates a separate thread, not affecting the UI thread.
    </p>
    <p>
        The graph is drawn on the canvas (another HTML5 feature).
        The location of the graph nodes are computed using an algorithm described in the paper ….
        The aim of this algorithm is to find locations of graph nodes on the plane so that it can be drawn
        a highly efficient way – reducing edges intersections, nodes overlapping, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another available feature is reading graph descriptions from the file and processing this file
        in the web browser (another HTML5 feature).
