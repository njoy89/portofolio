    In the first month, I was developing a web system used for the administration of a chain of kindergartens.
    The system was written in PHP. Then, I was assigned to a team of four people with whom I worked with
    .NET technologies (ASP.NET with C#, Microsoft SQL Server 2008) on a web application that was also used
    by school staff.
