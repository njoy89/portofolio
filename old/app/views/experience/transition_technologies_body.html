    I worked as an iOS developer on a package of applications that support blind and visually-impaired people
    in everyday life. The application that I worked most on was <strong>VIRTUAL EYE MoveAssistant</strong> -
    an iOS app that provides advanced geo-location and navigation features as well as current weather reports.
