            Hello, I'm Grzegorz Swatowski.
        </h4>
        <p>
            I'm a front-end developer with significant experience in VanillaJS and AngularJS and recently graduated in
            Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. My area of interests includes developing heavy single
            page applications, exploring frantic client-side JavaScript frameworks, libraries and front-end development
            tools, writing high performance JavaScript code consistent with the ECMAScript 6 standard as well as
            speeding up websites using various techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working at <a href="http://www.codilime.com/" target="_blank">Codilime</a> on the
            <a href="http://deepsense.io/" target="_blank">DeepSense</a> project.
        </p>
        <p>On this page, you can find information about me, including a description of my whole professional experience,
            a list of a few projects with details that I developed and a short 'tour' through my passions and
            nonacademic and nonprofessional activities.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this page has been created due to professional purposes - to show off my software developer's
            background as good as possible. Furthermore, I had a strong desire to learn technologies constituting the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN" target="_blank">MEAN stack</a> as well as some other fancy ones,
            and actually this was the primary motivation to create this web site.</p>
        <p>I am an <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> enthusiast and fond of coding in pure JavaScript.
            This site has been created among others in this frantic technology.</p>
        <p>I'm glad you're here and I am looking forward to getting any feedback from you!</p>
